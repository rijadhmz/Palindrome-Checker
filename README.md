## Palindrome Checker

This project is a plain JavaScript implementation of a Palindrome Checker. It was developed as part of the FreeCodeCamp "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course certification.

### Project Description

The goal of this project is to determine whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word or sentence that reads the same forward and backward, disregarding punctuation, case, and spacing. The program removes all non-alphanumeric characters and converts the string to a uniform case before checking for palindromes.

### Challenge Requirement

**Challenge:** Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

**Additional Requirements:**
- Remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces, and symbols).
- Convert the string to the same case (lower or upper case) for comparison.

The project handles various input formats, including strings with different cases and special symbols.

### Example Inputs and Outputs

- Input: "racecar"
  Output: true

- Input: "RaceCar"
  Output: true

- Input: "2A3*3a2"
  Output: true

- Input: "hello"
  Output: false

### Technologies Used

- Plain JavaScript

This project showcases foundational JavaScript skills and the ability to solve algorithmic challenges.
